# rust-testing

Install using exe downloaded from 
https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe

Should probably have used this instead:
https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/rustup-init.exe


Ran through example.

Opened in clion - worked fine. Issue debugging.
